Universal Scene Description (USD) is the software developed by Pixar that addresses the need to robustly and scalably interchange and augment arbitrary 3D scenes that may be composed from many elemental assets. 

USD provides for interchange of elemental assets (e.g. models) or animations.  But unlike other interchange packages, USD also enables assembly and organization of any number of assets into virtual sets, scenes, and shots, transmit them from application to application, and non-destructively edit them (as overrides), with a single, consistent API, in a single scenegraph.  USD provides a [rich toolset](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/USD-Toolset.html) for reading, writing, editing, and rapidly previewing 3D geometry and shading.  In addition, because USD's core scenegraph and ["composition engine"](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/USD-Glossary.html#USDGlossary-Composition) are agnostic of 3D, USD can be extended in a maintainable way to encode and compose data in other domains.
